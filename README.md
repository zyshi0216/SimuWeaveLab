# SimuWeave Lab
SimuWeave Lab—an advanced body-mounted computing platform dedicated to solving data bottlenecks and experimental barriers and bridging the gap between cutting-edge fiber technology and practical applications.

## Mission Statement

SimuWeave Lab is committed to pioneering the future of fiber-based computing through simulation-driven innovation. By developing advanced digital models of flexible computing systems, we aim to bridge the gap between experimental fiber technologies and real-world intelligent applications. Our research integrates material science, computational modeling, machine learning, and flexible electronics to create high-fidelity virtual prototypes that accelerate innovation, reduce development costs, and enable the emergence of smarter, more resilient fiber computing systems.

## Vision

To establish SimuWeave Lab as a global leader in simulation and prototyping of fiber computing technologies, driving transformative advances in intelligent textiles, wearable computing, and soft robotics for the benefit of society.
